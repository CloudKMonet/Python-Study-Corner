    "# Making a Calculator with Python\n",
    "A difference from using C-sharp, is that python's version of a switch case is a match/case. So, instead of splitting the switch cases, a single block of code is suffcient (and at times more efficient) for a match/case. I have an example below of what code you would use if you have a version of python 3.11 and above (3.9 and below will not run the mactch choice example). But to make the calculcator universal, I also did a version that makes use of python's functions ( better known as: def)."
