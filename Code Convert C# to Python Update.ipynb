    "Reflecting on these two projects- I can say that despite being intitally done in c#- the python versions worked as intended. The tea menu is different from the coffee app since it's based on vibes; but the idea, which was mostly to make a container and have the user select an option from the container, was very sucessful. C# is a very structured language while python holds the advantage in being very fast and easy to use. Another thing I will say is, that, when translating between the codes- I ran into problems with remebering the case sensitivity difference between python and c#. I added some prices to the tea menu, but I'll leave any new update for the sheep counter for another time."
