I wanted to add different type of sheep for the user's personal pick, then I kept the loop the same for the simulated counting, but this time it counts whatever sheep the user picked from the selection. I also went back to my previous c sharp code and translated it over so this app follows the c sharp version exactly... just in Python :P"
