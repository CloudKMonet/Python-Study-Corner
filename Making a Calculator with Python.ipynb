    "# Making a Calculator with Python\n",
    "A difference from using C-sharp, is that python's version of a switch case is a match/case. Instead of splitting the switch cases, a single block of code is suffcient (and at times more efficient) for a match/case. So this calcultor has a single match/case as opposed to when I made a C-sharp calculator which contained two switch cases."
