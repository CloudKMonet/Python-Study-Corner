    "To reflect, these two projects were intitally done in c#, I just wanted to do a version in python. The tea menu is different from the coffee app, but the idea was mostly to make a container and have the user select an option from the container. C# is a very structured language while python holds the advantage in being very fast and easy to use. I will say, I ran into problems with remebering the case sensitivities between python and c#. But! I got the basics done in this. If I were to continue to adjust and update the code in the future, I think a good addtion is potentially adding more user input into the tea menu- like maybe the user has an idea for a custom tea order for the barista. For the Counting Sheep, it needs to not print that else statement, and maybe even have the types of sheep the user sees as they count and fall asleep is a selction like an array. Overall, very fun!"
