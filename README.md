# Python-Study-Corner
This is my study corner! All of it is Python coding. I thoroughly enjoyed learning the language in college,
but the primary language I learned and studied was with C#. So, I wanted a repository specifically
dedicated to my python codes, as well as allow me to continue to practice and expand my code 
repertoire. 

## House-keeping
Looking into any of my Python Repositories you'll notice I specifically upload Jupyter notebooks. 
If you want to try any of these codes out, feel free. Another repository I have is dedicated to my machine learning applied studies 
utilizing the python language to set up analysis, and models. Consider this repository my more beginner friendly codes, 
whilst my AI and ML repository contain more of an intermediate side.
